# BetterDino
- BetterDino is a game inspired from the Dinosaur Game we play when we get no internet connection on our browser. This project focuses on modifying or adding features to the preexisting game in the hopes of making it "better" using pygame and GIMP as our main tools.
## To do:
- [ ] Add ability to pause the game where player still able to see the screen, the screen is grey, pause icon.
- [ ] Create a better menu/start screen.
- [ ] Add a boss; boss is trigerred after player reaches certain condition (for example: reaches 2000 points).
- [ ] Create better hitbox for the sprites
- [ ] Create user save file
- [ ] Replace the dino's ability to destroy tumbleweed by clicking to shooting fireballs and when it hits it, the tumbleweed gets burnt
- [x] Add the ability of using W and S equivalent to Up key and Down key respectively.
- [ ] Set three lives per games
- [ ] Set death animation
